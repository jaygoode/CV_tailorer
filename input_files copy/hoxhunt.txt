our Mission
Your mission as a Hoxhunt Summer Hunter is simple and powerful: help build software that protects people and organizations from hackers, phishers, and cybercrime.

You’ll work on real products used globally, contributing code that raises awareness against phishing and cyberattacks and helps secure digital societies. This isn’t a sandbox internship, it’s a chance to create meaningful impact while learning how modern, scalable software is built in a fast-growing cybersecurity company.

You don’t need to be a finished product. We’re here to help you grow into the Data/ML engineer you want to become.

Your Role
As a Summer Hunter, you’ll work in a product development team alongside experienced engineers who are excited to mentor, support, and challenge you.

You’ll contribute to real pipelines, models and analytical workflows, while working on real problems, exploring different paths in data & ML engineering and sharpening your technical foundations.

What You’ll Do
Build and develop data pipelines, analytical features, or machine learning components used in real production systems

Collaborate with experienced data and software engineers in a supportive team environment

Learn how scalable data systems and ML workflows are designed, built, and maintained

Write clean, maintainable code and continuously improve it through feedback

Take part in team rituals, reviews, and discussions that shape our product

Our key technologies include Python, SQL, modern data warehouses, cloud platforms, Docker, and tools for data processing and machine learning. We actively experiment with frontier models and modern AI development tools, and continuously evaluate new approaches and technologies to improve how we build and learn.

What We’re Looking For
We’re looking for curious minds and motivated builders. You might be early in your journey, but you’re excited to learn and grow.

You likely have:

Passion for continuous learning and professional development

Attention to detail, analytical thinking, and creative problem-solving skills

Curiosity towards new technologies and scalable data systems and/or machine learning

A degree (completed or ongoing) in data science, mathematics, statistics, computer science or a related field

Basic knowledge of Python, SQL, Git, Linux/Mac command line, and interest in working with data at scale

Fluent written and spoken English

We’re ideally looking for someone who can continue working with us after the summer, either part-time or full-time

Bonus Points If You Also
Enjoy collaborating and learning through feedback

Have personal projects, coursework, or side projects you’re proud of

Have understanding about topics such as software development, software architectures, or requirements engineering

Are interested in cybersecurity, gaming, or education technology

Have recently graduated or are close to graduating (for example, only missing a thesis)
