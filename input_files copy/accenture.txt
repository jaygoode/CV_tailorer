In the era of Data & AI, the possibilities to make a change are limitless. Join our diverse team of professionals to help our Nordic and global customers design, build, and scale Generative AI solutions that drive real business value. We are now looking for Generative AI Engineers with hands-on experience in creating LLM-powered applications and platforms—covering retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), prompt engineering, model evaluation, safety & governance, and LLMOps. In your role, you will build solutions together with our clients using modern tools and cloud services, integrating the latest advances in GenAI into our clients’ core business processes.

Your work will span the following areas

Designing, building, and operating GenAI-enabled applications (chat, summarization, agents, copilots, content generation) for enterprise use cases
Implementing RAG pipelines: document ingestion, chunking, embeddings, vector stores, retrieval strategies, and answer synthesis
Prompt engineering and tool/function calling; building and orchestrating multi-step agents/workflows
Establishing LLMOps foundations: CI/CD for prompts and chains, offline/online evaluation, observability, telemetry, A/B testing, and continuous improvement
Integrating on‑premises and cloud data sources securely with attention to PII, data residency, and GDPR
Selecting and operating model endpoints (managed APIs and self/managed hosting), including performance tuning, caching, and cost optimization
Building guardrails and safety layers (grounding, policy enforcement, content filters, redaction) and aligning with Responsible AI practices
Collaborating with data, platform, and application teams to land GenAI in production with robust APIs, monitoring, and SLOs
You preferably have experience in some of the following (and interest to grow in the others)

LLM platforms & clouds: Azure OpenAI / Azure AI, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, open‑source models (Llama, Mistral, etc.)
Orchestration & agents: Semantic Kernel, LangChain, LlamaIndex, function/tool calling, planner/agent patterns
RAG components: vector databases (Azure AI Search, FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone), embedding models, hybrid search, re-ranking
Evaluation & quality: RAGAS/DeepEval-like frameworks, golden sets, hallucination & toxicity checks, guardrails
Application dev: Python (FastAPI), TypeScript/Node.js; API design, streaming, and event-driven patterns
MLOps/LLMOps: MLflow/W&B, feature & model registries, prompt/version management, experiment tracking, telemetry
Data & integration: document processing (OCR, parsing), knowledge graph/metadata enrichment, connectors to enterprise systems
Batch/stream processing (nice to have): Spark/Databricks, Airflow, Kafka/Flink for data prep supporting GenAI workloads
Performance & infra (nice to have): containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), GPU acceleration, quantization/optimization (ONNX, vLLM, TensorRT), caching/indexing strategies
Security & compliance: Responsible AI controls, GDPR & PII handling

To succeed in this role, we expect the following key qualifications:

Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related technical field
Preferably at least one cloud certificate (Azure, AWS, or GCP) and/or relevant AI/GenAI certifications
Understanding and interest in end‑to‑end GenAI solution development—from solution design and data grounding to quality assurance, safety, and production operations
Skills in modern software engineering: version control (Git), documentation, automated testing, CI/CD, and agile teamwork
Strong willingness and enthusiasm to learn and continuously develop skills in a rapidly evolving GenAI landscape
Ability to be an innovative, resourceful, and collaborative problem solver with a product mindset
